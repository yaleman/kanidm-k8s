    #   If you have a known filesystem, kanidm can tune sqlite to match. Valid choices are:
    #   [zfs, other]
    #   If you are unsure about this leave it as the default (other). After changing this
    #   value you must run a vacuum task.
    #   - zfs:
    #     * sets sqlite pagesize to 64k. You must set recordsize=64k on the zfs filesystem.
    #   - other:
    #     * sets sqlite pagesize to 4k, matching most filesystems block sizes.
    # db_fs_type = "zfs"

    #   The number of entries to store in the in-memory cache.
    #   Minimum value is 256. If unset an automatic heuristic is used to scale this.

    #   The log level of the server. May be default, verbose,
    #   perfbasic, perffull
    #   Defaults to "default"
    # log_level = "default"
    #
    #   The DNS domain name of the server. This is used in a
    #   number of security-critical contexts
    #   such as webauthn, so it *must* match your DNS
    #   hostname. It is used to create
    #   security principal names such as `william@idm.example.com`
    #   so that in a (future)
    #   trust configuration it is possible to have unique Service
    #   Principal Names (spns) throughout the topology.
    #   ⚠️  WARNING ⚠️
    #   Changing this value WILL break many types of registered
    #   credentials for accounts
    #   including but not limited to webauthn, oauth tokens, and more.
    #   If you change this value you *must* run
    #   `kanidmd domain_name_change` immediately after.

    #
    #   The origin for webauthn. This is the url to the server,
    #   with the port included if
    #   it is non-standard (any port except 443). This must match
    #   or be a descendent of the
    #   domain name you configure above. If these two items are
    #   not consistent, the server WILL refuse to start!
    #   origin = "https://idm.example.com"
    origin = "https://idm.example.com"
    #
    #   The role of this server. This affects available features
    #   and how replication may interact.
    #   Valid roles are:
    #   - WriteReplica
    #     This server provides all functionality of Kanidm. It
    #     allows authentication, writes, and
    #     the web user interface to be served.
    #   - WriteReplicaNoUI
    #     This server is the same as a WriteReplica, but does NOT
    #     offer the web user interface.
    #   - ReadOnlyReplica
    #     This server will not writes initiated by clients. It
    #     supports authentication and reads,
    #     and must have a replication agreement as a source of
    #     its data.
    #   Defaults to "WriteReplica".
    role = "WriteReplicaNoUI"
    #
    # [online_backup]
    #   The path to the output folder for online backups
    # path = "/var/lib/kanidm/backups/"
    #   The schedule to run online backups (see https://crontab.guru/)
    #   every day at 22:00 UTC (default)
    # schedule = "00 22 * * *"
    #    four times a day at 3 minutes past the hour, every 6th hours
    # schedule = "03 */6 * * *"
    #   Number of backups to keep (default 7)
    # versions = 7
